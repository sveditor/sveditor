-- 0.0.5 Release --

== Completely new pre-processor architecture. Files in a build-path directory
are processed in two passes now. First, the files are scanned for pre-processor
definitions, conditionals, and inclusions. Then, when a file is scanned, the
build context of the file is computed (ie which chain of files is likely to
include the file being parsed). This allows us to determine which macros
will be 'live' during file processing.

The new pre-processor architecture allows SVEditor to deal with the heavy 
macro use of libraries such as OVM. Now, for example, it is possible to
provide content-assist for class elements in OVM classes that are contributed
by macros (eg tasks in the various TLM port classes).

== Continued work on content-assist. Now, the expression surrounding the 
content-assist point is processed so better suggestions can be provided. 
Also, more context information from the class hierarchy is used. 
For example:

- given the classes:

class bar;
    ovm_master_port #(int, int)    p;

endclass

class foo extends bar;
    

    function void do_something();
       p.<CONTENT ASSIST> 
        
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes that 'p' is the variable for 
content-assist, locates 'p' via the class hierarchy, and prompts for tasks,
functions, and fields in the class ovm_master_port.


- given the classes:

class bar;

    int a, b, c;

endclass


class foo;

    function bar get_bar();
    endfunction

    function void do_something();
        get_bar().<CONTENT ASSIST>
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes the function 'get_bar', finds the 
return type, and prompts for fields, tasks, etc from the class bar.


== Added code templates to content assist. This provides argument templates
for tasks, functions, macros, and templated classes. 


== The content-assist processor can provide content-assist proposals for 
include files. Typing: `include <CONTENT ASSIST> or 
`include "prefix<CONTENT ASSIST> will present a list of matching 
include-file names.




20090102 -- Fix outline label provider
20090103 -- Eliminate duplicate proposals for include files
         -- Fixed indexing of files in workspace paths. Previously, only files
            in non-workspace build paths were added to the index. 
20090105 -- Correct skipping of constraint body. Constraint body is now ignored
         -- Pre-processor seems to not always ignore comment content
20090106 -- Correct problem with pre-processor that resulted in scanner incorrectly
            processing lines that end with a single-line comment.
         -- Correct problem with parsing identifiers directly followed by ':'. 
            For example, endfunction: myfunction
20090107 -- Update line numbers of SVDB items parsed from the live editor. Affected source
            is in SVDBFileMerger, SVDBItem, and SVDBScopeItem.

        * Change structure of pre-processor and scanner for better pre-processor support

* Field-attribute icons on outline now update properly when the attributes
  change (ie protected -> local)
* Fix problems with line-number accuracy and macro substitution
    * Better, but still off-by-one occasionally
* Enhance 'open declaration' to use the index to traverse the class 
  hierarchy and find tasks, functions, fields

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.3 Release --

20081101 - 
    - Add dedicated C-style comment detector for multi-line comments. Fixes
      cases where the Eclipse built-in multi-line pattern detector failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Future --

- Content Assist
    * Prompt for macro parameters
    * Prompt for class template parameters
    * Parse chained expressions (foo().a.b)
        * Live scan of file doesn't seem to be up-to-date when used for content assist
          
    - Use template parameters of super classes to provide better proposals
    - Support task/function variables
    * Add parameters to the display string for task/function content assist
- SVDB Data Flow Changes
    * SVEditor must be responsible for updating the 'live' copy of the SVDBFile
        - On document change, the data is scanned and merged to the SVDBFile the SVEditor caches
        - Users of this SVDBFile must register listeners on the SVEditor
        - Not clear that we actually must ensure that the Explorer view is the same as the Outline view
        - Use modification information as hints to preserve helpful SVDB information
            - 
- Hover info-pops
    - Use same basic parsing strategy as content-assist, but use to drive info-pops that display
      information about the element under the cursor
    - Preserve and show attached comments

 - Begin work on users guide

 - SVDB Changes
    - Want to represent parameterized class instances as unique types. We can always back-reference
      the template class (could be helpful).
 - Scanner Improvements
    * Add support for scanning variable declarations within task/function scopes
    - Need a better strategy for detecting that we've left a scope during editing
        - The problem comes up when we miss info defined later in the file because of current user edits
        - Perhaps we can leverage the last-known-good data-structure and lines-modified information to determine
          what portions of the file leave un-touched (with the exception, perhaps, of updating line info)
    - Extend language coverage
        - Add support for structures
            - Structures are only supported as typedefs?
        - Add support for unions
        - Add support for typedefs
            - Need to ignore forward declarations (typedef class <>; typedef struct <>;)
        - Add exclusion for constraints
    - Better exclusions for behavioral code inside behavioral scopes
 - Open Declaration Improvements
    * Add Open Declaration support for included files
    - Scan context, rather than just using highlighted term
    - Recognize 'super' and search hierarchy
 - Need to create data files for the base SystemVerilog library, so we can prompt the users for built-in methods
 - Add auto-indent rules centered around begin/end and brackets
 - Add inheritance hierarchy viewer
 - Notification on build-path change. Ensure setting a new build path results in re-scanning
 - Need a better strategy for cross-editor navigation. We loose our build-path context when we switch to an editor for a file on the build path
 * Investigate mismatch between macro def and invocation parameter counts
 - Support folding of begin/end regions
 - Add Design Hierarchy view, showing modules and their instantiation     
   relationships
 - Some sort of library-specific macro filtering could be helpful. (eg don't expand `ovm_component_utils)

 - Update build-path management to support
    - 'library' entries -- single file that is the root of a library (eg OVM)
    - filtering source from 

 - Support persisting SVDB. Saves time after the first parse

 * Support read-only source in a plugin. Useful for libraries (OVM/VMM).
    - A library index processes files as follows:
        - Entry point is root file
        - Any file included by that file or sub-files is included in the index
        - Process recursively:
            - At each level, create an SVDBFileTree object to work with
            - Reference parent's SVDBFileTree object
                -> Must 'pre-process' SVDBFileTree to resolve conditionals
            - Monitor inclusions. As files are included:
                - Ensure they exist as SVDBFileTree objects
                - Add to the DefineProvider
                - Check whether file has already been parsed. 
                    - Add to TODO list if not
