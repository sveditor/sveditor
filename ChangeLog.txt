-- 0.2.2 Release --

- Support content assist for SystemVerilog keywords

- Fix bugs, introduced by the new parser, in support for covergroup 
  content assist and added tests

- Enhance the Project Explorer with a Project Paths entry that allows the
  directory structure of indexes (workspace internal and external) to be 
  browsed. This makes it significantly easier to open a file that is part
  of an index that is outside the filesystem. It also makes it easier to
  see what is present in the index paths of a project.

- Enhanced Argument File index to support argument files that reference
  paths outside the workspace. An example of this case is shown in the
  OVM 'xbus' example. The example project is 'xbus', but the argument file
  in the project references the OVM library several directory levels 
  above -- outside the project directory.

? Enhance support for content assist in 'module' context
    - Ensure ports parsed
    - Search ports (same as function parameters) when searching up
    - 

? Support parameter declaration in module bodies

-- 0.2.1 Release --

- Corrected a pretty severe auto-indent bug related to pasting the opening 
(and not closing) portion of a multi-line comment. Now SVEditor does not
attempt to auto-indent cases where newly-pasted content makes comment
boundaries ambiguous

- Correct a bug with hierarchy-based navigation (ie Open Declaration) that
caused navigation history to not be maintained properly

- Extensive changes to the parsing framework, which will example improvements
  to the accuracy and extent of parsing.

- Extended content assist to structs -- both typedef and inline-decl

- Extended content assist to comprehend extern functions and search the
  corresponding class scope

- Annotate editor with error markers from the parser. For now, this should 
  be helpful in understanding where the parser is encountering parser errors.
  As the parser adds features, this should be a useful tool for SystemVerilog
  developers.


-- 0.2.0 Release --

- Add basic support for code templates. Currently, no built-in code templates
  are provided, though contributions are very welcome. Suggestions for
  extending code-template support are, likewise, welcome.

-- 0.1.9 Release --

- Correct a macro-expansion bug with nested macros that was triggered 
  by the VMM library source

- Correct a bug with handling of endfunction/endtask with a end label 

-- 0.1.8 Release --

- Make auto-indenter adaptive to surrounding scope indent. This means that
  if class methods have the same indent as the class scope (aligned to margin),
  the auto-identer will indent the method body statements one tab in from the
  margin.

- Corrected a bug with auto-indent paste and strings with embedded 
  control characters. In this situation, the pasted content would 'disappear'.

- Enhance content-assist when editing parameterized classes by searching 
  class parameters as a data-type

- Enable full-file indent via CTRL-I. Previously, this operation was diabled.

- Resolved a bug in auto-indent scanner that caused some combinations of 
  empty lines to be collapsed into one

- Filter __sv_builtin classes from super-class proposal list

- Change default focus in 'New SV Class' wizard to 'Class Name' field

- Add scanner support for 'pure virtual' tasks/functions

- Auto-indent now recognizes foreach as a loop construct

-- 0.1.7 Release --

- Add class-creation wizard that supports browsing for a super-class and 
  implementing the constructor with super-constructor parameters


-- 0.1.6 Release --

- Correct include-pathing issue for nested defines. 

- Correct macro-resolution bug for macros defined in sub-included files

- Update list of supported directives. Most of these are ignored for now, but
  produce no errors.
    - `celldefine 
    - `endcelldefine
    - `line
    - `nounconnected_drive
    - `resetall
    - `unconnected_drive
    - `undef
    - `undefineall

- Fix project explorer to not display error markers as part of the file structure

-- 0.1.5 Release --

- Resolve a bug in indent support for always 

- Resolve a critical bug with file paths on Windows

-- 0.1.4 Release --

- Add content-assist support for class typedefs. Now, class typedefs are 
recognized as aliases for the underlying type.

- Correct a bug with content assist for macros having no parameters. 
Previously, these macros were displayed incorrectly in the content proposal.

- Correct a bug with content-assist on the RHS of an '='. 

- Correct a bug with expression indenting. Fix bug / add tests for indenting of covergroups, coverpoints.

- Fix bug with opening a file that exists in the root of a project

- Correct a windows-specific bug that resulted in the built-in library
  missing files

- Correct a bug with indenting pre-processor directives such as `timescale

- Collect and display errors as markers
    - Missing define
    - Missing include file
    - Annotate the parent index that manages the file 

- Expand testing of indexing
    - Library Index
        - Ensure new files are correctly merged in
            - On load, discovering a previously-missing file triggers an 
              index build (Workspace and Filesystem varieties)
            - During operation, adding a file that was previously a 
              missing include triggers index rebuild (Workspace only)
        - Ensure global defines are propagated
        - Ensure missing includes/defines are annotated
    - Argument File Index
        - On load, discovering an updated index triggers index rebuild
        - Ensure index is re-scanned when the argument file changes
        - Ensure global defines are propagated
        - Ensure missing includes/defines are annotated
    - Plugin Lib Index
        - Ensure new files added (ie new release) result in updated index. 
    - SourceCollection Index
        - Update structure-determining logic to recognize 
          package,module,interface, and program-based structures
        - Ensure global defines are propagated
        - Ensure included files are located
        - Ensure missing includes/defines are annotated

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.1.3 Release --

- Change the way that files are associated with indexes. Previously, only the
containing project's indexes were checked to locate the index a file should
be associated with. Typical setup for projects with a single build file and 
multiple source locations do not work well with this scheme.  
Now, the following is done:
    - The file's containing project is checked to see if it manages the index.
      This gives local settings priority
    - Next, other open projects in the workspace are checked
    - Finally, shadow indexes in the projects are checked

- Correct bug with propagation of +define+ arguments from the argument file
to the index define map.

- Add Project Properties page for setting global pre-processor defines

- Update indexers to use global defines. Now, the user can provide global
defines -- ones, for instance, that might be provided directed to the 
compile command.

- Fixed a few minor bugs in indent support and added a few tests

- Fix a minor pre-processor bug with macro expansion

- Fix bug with indent of forever. Add test

- Add content-assist support for '= new()'. Now, content assist provides 
the constructor argument list.

- Correct a bug with the Type Hierarchy view where a non-extended class
is not shown.

- Add icon for Coverpoint Cross

- Add content-assist support for import. 

- Add content assist for covergroups and coverpoints
    - Support for accessing covergroup and sub-coverpoints in an expression
    - Support for built-in methods (get_coverage, sample, etc)
    - Support covergroup, coverpoint, and coverpoint cross options 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.1.2 Release --

- Add content-assist support for parameterized classes. Now, content assist
will parse and operate on the specialized class rather than its base type. 
This means that, for example, content assist can 'see through' a parameterized
member field.

- Improve content-assist support for dynamic arrays, queues, and 
associative arrays. Now, methods that are part of the type (ie queue) are 
provided as content-assist proposals.

- Add Class Hierarchy viewer. Selecting a class name in the editor and opening
the Hierarchy view via the shortcut (F4) or the context menu will display the
class super- and sub- class hierarchy. Class members for the selected class
are shown in a separate pane. The source location for Classes and members 
may be opened by double-clicking on the appropriate element in the 
Hierarchy viewer.

- Fix bug with accepting a expression content proposal with no leaf. 
For example: foo.<CTRL-SPACE>. Previously, performing this operation would
result in the content being inserted at the beginning of the document. 

- Apply auto-indent to content inserted by Override Methods dialog

- Correct a bug in the scanner with extern tasks/functions outside a 
class/package scope

- Fix auto-indent bugs
    - Support package as an indent scope
    - Resolve issues when typing at the very end of a document.
    - Properly indent class declarations within packages and modules
    - Correct issue with indenting extern task/function
    - Support fork/join* as an indent scope
    - Fix problem with pasting, with auto-indent, in the middle of a port map

- Remove OVM plugin library from distribution. Source from user's environment
is typically used.

- Add SystemVerilog system tasks and functions to the default library. These
now appear as content assist proposals

- Correct a bug with scanning class declarations that occur on a single line

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.1.1 Release --

- Add the beginnings of an indenter. To activate, select text in the editor
and select <CTRL>-I. Currently, blocks such as classes, modules, 
tasks/functions, and begin/end blocks are supported. 
    - This is still fairly experimental functionality. Please report any
      issues you see!
    - Unclear how best to indent macro invocations, since many 
      are not terminated at statement boundaries (at least in OVM). 
      For now, assuming that macro invocations end at a line boundary.

- Update on-the-fly auto-indent to use the new indenter. This replaces a 
whole raft of heuristic code that was less than reliable. However, as noted
above, the new indenter is less than fully-tested, so expect some instability. 

- Support auto-indent for paste using the indenter. This functionality is 
only enabled if auto-indent is enabled in the SVEditor Preferences.

- Auto-indent is enabled by default for 'new' workspaces. For existing 
workspaces, the user will need to enable auto-indent via the SVEditor 
preferences page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.1.0 Release --

- Ensure that changes to task/function arguments are updated in the database
when the file changes.

- Make expression parsing more selective with respect to quoted strings. 
Content assist adjacent to a string (eg in a $display() call) now works 
much better

- Corrected a lookup bug that prevented task/function parameters or locals
from being presented as content-assist proposals

- Added support for always/initial blocks and assigns to the scanner and 
outline view

- Direct debug output (enabled from SVEditor preferences page) to console
in active workbench.

- Update support for enumerated types. Enum types and values are presented
and typenames can be cross-referenced

- Update Outline view to show function return type

- Changed content-assist searches to be case-insensitive. The code architecture
is also now more modular, to permit easier future updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.9 Release --

- Corrected a bug with implicit-relative paths in an argument file. 
Previously, ./<path> and ../<path> were recognized as relative paths. 
Now <path> is also recognized as a relative path.

- Corrected a bug in processing virtual interface fields. The scanner was 
incorrectly identifying these fields as a change of scope. Interface is a 
first-level keyword, but virtual interface is a valid field.

- Corrected problem in parsing indexed expressions when extracting
root/trigger/leaf from an expression.

- Enhanced expression parsing (translation from text to SVDBItems) to account
for static references based as a class type: <class>::<field>::...

- Enhanced the lookup procedure performed by the editor on startup to 
determine which index manages a given source file. Extended to recognize
files from the filesystem that are managed by an index attached to a 
project in the workspace.

- Corrected a bug with class-field lookup (cross-linking and context assist) 
where the super-class hierarchy was not considered.

- Centralized lookup code for expressions, combining content-assist and
cross-linking lookup



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.8 Release --

The 0.0.8 release contains major changes to SVEditor. 

The source-discovery mechanism has changed completely. Now, for best results, 
the user should provide SVEditor with paths to the package files and/or 
file lists that specify the source files. If a file is opened that is 
not part of a defined index, SVEditor will setup a temporary index containing 
just files in the parent directory.

Improvements have continued on the persistence support. On exit of Eclipse, 
SVEditor saves the parsed representation of all active indexes to the workspace. 
SVEditor is able to simply re-load the database from this save file if 
none of the SystemVerilog files have subseqently been modified. 
This can save a significant amount of time during Eclipse startup by reducing 
the amount of redundant parsing. 

Added logging infrastructure, including a method to control debug logging
from the preferences page and saving the debug log to a file in the workspace.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.7 Release --
    - Fix DR 2689430 -- problem with opening/closing/deleting a project in workspace
        - Sometimes a resource-change event is signaled with a null event
    - Add patch from <> for basic color preferences
    - Incorporate patch from <> for DR <> -- problem with paths on Windows
    - Fix problem with source cross-reference to classes declared 
      directly within a package. This issue did not affect classes declared
      within a package via an `include directive.
    - Add persistence support to prevent unchanged source files from being 
      re-parsed on every invocation
*   - Fix problem with resolving macros in the SourceCollection index
    - Expanded index support with the following new types
        - Source collection index -- examines file structure and attempts to 
          determine correct parse order based on include relationships
        - Library index -- entry point is the root file of a package-based
          library. Locates included files
        - Plugin library -- support for packaging common source in a plugin
          that can be distributed with SVEditor
    - 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [Development] Add an extension point that allows SystemVerilog libraries 
  to be packaged in a plug-in
- Begin adding support for core SystemVerilog classes (string for now)
- Add OVM 2.0.1 to as a built-in library
- Fix DR 2683568 -- scanner problem when parsing incomplete begin-end block
- Add basic support for DPI tasks/functions in the scanner
- Fixed a problem with content assist on task/function parameter names
- Added an icon for local variables and task parameters


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.5 Release --

== Completely new pre-processor architecture. Files in a build-path directory
are processed in two passes now. First, the files are scanned for pre-processor
definitions, conditionals, and inclusions. Then, when a file is scanned, the
build context of the file is computed (ie which chain of files is likely to
include the file being parsed). This allows us to determine which macros
will be 'live' during file processing.

The new pre-processor architecture allows SVEditor to deal with the heavy 
macro use of libraries such as OVM. Now, for example, it is possible to
provide content-assist for class elements in OVM classes that are contributed
by macros (eg tasks in the various TLM port classes).

== Continued work on content-assist. Now, the expression surrounding the 
content-assist point is processed so better suggestions can be provided. 
Also, more context information from the class hierarchy is used. 
For example:

- given the classes:

class bar;
    ovm_master_port #(int, int)    p;

endclass

class foo extends bar;
    

    function void do_something();
       p.<CONTENT ASSIST> 
        
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes that 'p' is the variable for 
content-assist, locates 'p' via the class hierarchy, and prompts for tasks,
functions, and fields in the class ovm_master_port.


- given the classes:

class bar;

    int a, b, c;

endclass


class foo;

    function bar get_bar();
    endfunction

    function void do_something();
        get_bar().<CONTENT ASSIST>
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes the function 'get_bar', finds the 
return type, and prompts for fields, tasks, etc from the class bar.


== Added code templates to content assist. This provides argument templates
for tasks, functions, macros, and templated classes. 


== The content-assist processor can provide content-assist proposals for 
include files. Typing: `include <CONTENT ASSIST> or 
`include "prefix<CONTENT ASSIST> will present a list of matching 
include-file names.




20090102 -- Fix outline label provider
20090103 -- Eliminate duplicate proposals for include files

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.3 Release --

20081101 - 
    - Add dedicated C-style comment detector for multi-line comments. Fixes
      cases where the Eclipse built-in multi-line pattern detector failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Future --

- Content Assist
    * Prompt for macro parameters
    * Prompt for class template parameters
    * Parse chained expressions (foo().a.b)
        * Live scan of file doesn't seem to be up-to-date when used for content assist
          
    - Use template parameters of super classes to provide better proposals
    - Support task/function variables
    * Add parameters to the display string for task/function content assist
- SVDB Data Flow Changes
    * SVEditor must be responsible for updating the 'live' copy of the SVDBFile
        - On document change, the data is scanned and merged to the SVDBFile the SVEditor caches
        - Users of this SVDBFile must register listeners on the SVEditor
        - Not clear that we actually must ensure that the Explorer view is the same as the Outline view
        - Use modification information as hints to preserve helpful SVDB information
            - 
- Hover info-pops
    - Use same basic parsing strategy as content-assist, but use to drive info-pops that display
      information about the element under the cursor
    - Preserve and show attached comments

 - Begin work on users guide

 - SVDB Changes
 - Scanner Improvements
    * Add support for scanning variable declarations within task/function scopes
    - Need a better strategy for detecting that we've left a scope during editing
        - The problem comes up when we miss info defined later in the file because of current user edits
        - Perhaps we can leverage the last-known-good data-structure and lines-modified information to determine
          what portions of the file leave un-touched (with the exception, perhaps, of updating line info)
    - Extend language coverage
        - Add support for structures
            - Structures are only supported as typedefs?
        - Add support for unions

    - Better exclusions for behavioral code inside behavioral scopes
 * Open Declaration Improvements
    * Add Open Declaration support for included files
    * Scan context, rather than just using highlighted term
    * Recognize 'super' and search hierarchy
 - Need to create data files for the base SystemVerilog library, so we can prompt the users for built-in methods
 - Add auto-indent rules centered around begin/end and brackets
 - Add inheritance hierarchy viewer
 - Notification on build-path change. Ensure setting a new build path results in re-scanning
 - Need a better strategy for cross-editor navigation. We loose our build-path context when we switch to an editor for a file on the build path
 * Investigate mismatch between macro def and invocation parameter counts
 - Support folding of begin/end regions
 - Add Design Hierarchy view, showing modules and their instantiation     
   relationships
 - Some sort of library-specific macro filtering could be helpful. (eg don't expand `ovm_component_utils)

 * Update build-path management to support
    - 'library' entries -- single file that is the root of a library (eg OVM)
    - filtering source from 

 * Support persisting SVDB. Saves time after the first parse

 * Support read-only source in a plugin. Useful for libraries (OVM/VMM).
    - A library index processes files as follows:
        - Entry point is root file
        - Any file included by that file or sub-files is included in the index
        - Process recursively:
            - At each level, create an SVDBFileTree object to work with
            - Reference parent's SVDBFileTree object
                -> Must 'pre-process' SVDBFileTree to resolve conditionals
            - Monitor inclusions. As files are included:
                - Ensure they exist as SVDBFileTree objects
                - Add to the DefineProvider
                - Check whether file has already been parsed. 
                    - Add to TODO list if not
 - Add basic support for Verilog .f files. This might be a concise way to specify the build process...
 - Need a multi-level sort for content proposals
    - order by name
    - 
    - order by scope distance (local variables, parameters, tf, types, etc)
    - any 

- Automate closing comments for blocks (emacs mode)
- Better navigation, based on expr utils -- super.run()


=== Improvements to Indexing ===
- Change indexing strategy to an explicit-include model
    - Must add nature to project
    - Must edit paths to add required
        - paths in the project
        - libraries inside or outside of the project
        - plugin-based libraries
    - Need indexing to be done as a job, so it is user-visible
- Add persistence model
