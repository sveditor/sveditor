-- 0.1.0 Release --

- Ensure that changes to task/function arguments are updated in the database
when the file changes.

- Make expression parsing more selective with respect to quoted strings. 
Content assist adjacent to a string (eg in a $display() call) now works 
much better

- Corrected a lookup bug that prevented task/function parameters or locals
from being presented as content-assist proposals

- Added support for always/initial blocks and assigns to the scanner and 
outline view

- Direct debug output (enabled from SVEditor preferences page) to console
in active workbench.

- Update support for enumerated types. Enum types and values are presented
and typenames can be cross-referenced

- Update Outline view to show function return type

-> Need to change prefix-matching to be modular 
(and in content-assist case, case-insensitive)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.9 Release --

- Corrected a bug with implicit-relative paths in an argument file. 
Previously, ./<path> and ../<path> were recognized as relative paths. 
Now <path> is also recognized as a relative path.

- Corrected a bug in processing virtual interface fields. The scanner was 
incorrectly identifying these fields as a change of scope. Interface is a 
first-level keyword, but virtual interface is a valid field.

- Corrected problem in parsing indexed expressions when extracting
root/trigger/leaf from an expression.

- Enhanced expression parsing (translation from text to SVDBItems) to account
for static references based as a class type: <class>::<field>::...

- Enhanced the lookup procedure performed by the editor on startup to 
determine which index manages a given source file. Extended to recognize
files from the filesystem that are managed by an index attached to a 
project in the workspace.

- Corrected a bug with class-field lookup (cross-linking and context assist) 
where the super-class hierarchy was not considered.

- Centralized lookup code for expressions, combining content-assist and
cross-linking lookup

-- 0.0.8 Release --

The 0.0.8 release contains major changes to SVEditor. 

The source-discovery mechanism has changed completely. Now, for best results, 
the user should provide SVEditor with paths to the package files and/or 
file lists that specify the source files. If a file is opened that is 
not part of a defined index, SVEditor will setup a temporary index containing 
just files in the parent directory.

Improvements have continued on the persistence support. On exit of Eclipse, 
SVEditor saves the parsed representation of all active indexes to the workspace. 
SVEditor is able to simply re-load the database from this save file if 
none of the SystemVerilog files have subseqently been modified. 
This can save a significant amount of time during Eclipse startup by reducing 
the amount of redundant parsing. 

Added logging infrastructure, including a method to control debug logging
from the preferences page and saving the debug log to a file in the workspace.

-- 0.0.7 Release --
    - Fix DR 2689430 -- problem with opening/closing/deleting a project in workspace
        - Sometimes a resource-change event is signaled with a null event
    - Add patch from <> for basic color preferences
    - Incorporate patch from <> for DR <> -- problem with paths on Windows

      re-parsed on every invocation
*   - Fix problem with resolving macros in the SourceCollection index
    - Expanded index support with the following new types
        - Source collection index -- examines file structure and attempts to 
          determine correct parse order based on include relationships
        - Library index -- entry point is the root file of a package-based
          library. Locates included files
        - Plugin library -- support for packaging common source in a plugin
          that can be distributed with SVEditor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.5 Release --

== Completely new pre-processor architecture. Files in a build-path directory
are processed in two passes now. First, the files are scanned for pre-processor
definitions, conditionals, and inclusions. Then, when a file is scanned, the
build context of the file is computed (ie which chain of files is likely to
include the file being parsed). This allows us to determine which macros
will be 'live' during file processing.

The new pre-processor architecture allows SVEditor to deal with the heavy 
macro use of libraries such as OVM. Now, for example, it is possible to
provide content-assist for class elements in OVM classes that are contributed
by macros (eg tasks in the various TLM port classes).

== Continued work on content-assist. Now, the expression surrounding the 
content-assist point is processed so better suggestions can be provided. 
Also, more context information from the class hierarchy is used. 
For example:

- given the classes:

class bar;
    ovm_master_port #(int, int)    p;

endclass

class foo extends bar;
    

    function void do_something();
       p.<CONTENT ASSIST> 
        
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes that 'p' is the variable for 
content-assist, locates 'p' via the class hierarchy, and prompts for tasks,
functions, and fields in the class ovm_master_port.


- given the classes:

class bar;

    int a, b, c;

endclass


class foo;

    function bar get_bar();
    endfunction

    function void do_something();
        get_bar().<CONTENT ASSIST>
    endfunction

endclass


The content-assist processor recognizes the function 'get_bar', finds the 
return type, and prompts for fields, tasks, etc from the class bar.


== Added code templates to content assist. This provides argument templates
for tasks, functions, macros, and templated classes. 


== The content-assist processor can provide content-assist proposals for 
include files. Typing: `include <CONTENT ASSIST> or 
`include "prefix<CONTENT ASSIST> will present a list of matching 
include-file names.




20090102 -- Fix outline label provider
20090103 -- Eliminate duplicate proposals for include files
         -- Fixed indexing of files in workspace paths. Previously, only files
            in non-workspace build paths were added to the index. 
20090105 -- Correct skipping of constraint body. Constraint body is now ignored
         -- Pre-processor seems to not always ignore comment content
20090106 -- Correct problem with pre-processor that resulted in scanner incorrectly
            processing lines that end with a single-line comment.
         -- Correct problem with parsing identifiers directly followed by ':'. 
            For example, endfunction: myfunction
20090107 -- Update line numbers of SVDB items parsed from the live editor. Affected source

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 0.0.3 Release --

20081101 - 
    - Add dedicated C-style comment detector for multi-line comments. Fixes
      cases where the Eclipse built-in multi-line pattern detector failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Future --

- Content Assist
    * Prompt for macro parameters
    * Prompt for class template parameters
    * Parse chained expressions (foo().a.b)
        * Live scan of file doesn't seem to be up-to-date when used for content assist
          
    - Use template parameters of super classes to provide better proposals
    - Support task/function variables
    * Add parameters to the display string for task/function content assist
- SVDB Data Flow Changes
    * SVEditor must be responsible for updating the 'live' copy of the SVDBFile
        - On document change, the data is scanned and merged to the SVDBFile the SVEditor caches
        - Users of this SVDBFile must register listeners on the SVEditor
        - Not clear that we actually must ensure that the Explorer view is the same as the Outline view
        - Use modification information as hints to preserve helpful SVDB information
            - 
- Hover info-pops
    - Use same basic parsing strategy as content-assist, but use to drive info-pops that display
      information about the element under the cursor
    - Preserve and show attached comments

 - Begin work on users guide

 - SVDB Changes
    - Want to represent parameterized class instances as unique types. We can always back-reference
      the template class (could be helpful).
 - Scanner Improvements
    * Add support for scanning variable declarations within task/function scopes
    - Need a better strategy for detecting that we've left a scope during editing
        - The problem comes up when we miss info defined later in the file because of current user edits
        - Perhaps we can leverage the last-known-good data-structure and lines-modified information to determine
          what portions of the file leave un-touched (with the exception, perhaps, of updating line info)
    - Extend language coverage
        - Add support for structures
            - Structures are only supported as typedefs?
        - Add support for unions
        - Add support for typedefs
            - Need to ignore forward declarations (typedef class <>; typedef struct <>;)
        - Add exclusion for constraints
    - Better exclusions for behavioral code inside behavioral scopes
 * Open Declaration Improvements
    * Add Open Declaration support for included files
    * Scan context, rather than just using highlighted term
    * Recognize 'super' and search hierarchy
 - Need to create data files for the base SystemVerilog library, so we can prompt the users for built-in methods
 - Add auto-indent rules centered around begin/end and brackets
 - Add inheritance hierarchy viewer
 - Notification on build-path change. Ensure setting a new build path results in re-scanning
 - Need a better strategy for cross-editor navigation. We loose our build-path context when we switch to an editor for a file on the build path
 * Investigate mismatch between macro def and invocation parameter counts
 - Support folding of begin/end regions
 - Add Design Hierarchy view, showing modules and their instantiation     
   relationships
 - Some sort of library-specific macro filtering could be helpful. (eg don't expand `ovm_component_utils)

 * Update build-path management to support
    - 'library' entries -- single file that is the root of a library (eg OVM)
    - filtering source from 

 * Support persisting SVDB. Saves time after the first parse

 * Support read-only source in a plugin. Useful for libraries (OVM/VMM).
    - A library index processes files as follows:
        - Entry point is root file
        - Any file included by that file or sub-files is included in the index
        - Process recursively:
            - At each level, create an SVDBFileTree object to work with
            - Reference parent's SVDBFileTree object
                -> Must 'pre-process' SVDBFileTree to resolve conditionals
            - Monitor inclusions. As files are included:
                - Ensure they exist as SVDBFileTree objects
                - Add to the DefineProvider
                - Check whether file has already been parsed. 
                    - Add to TODO list if not
 - Add basic support for Verilog .f files. This might be a concise way to specify the build process...
 - Need a multi-level sort for content proposals
    - order by name
    - 
    - order by scope distance (local variables, parameters, tf, types, etc)
    - any 

- Automate closing comments for blocks (emacs mode)
- Better navigation, based on expr utils -- super.run()


=== Improvements to Indexing ===
- Change indexing strategy to an explicit-include model
    - Must add nature to project
    - Must edit paths to add required
        - paths in the project
        - libraries inside or outside of the project
        - plugin-based libraries
    - Need indexing to be done as a job, so it is user-visible
- Add persistence model
