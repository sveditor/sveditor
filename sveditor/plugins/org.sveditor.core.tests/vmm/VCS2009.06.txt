The SystemVerilog code in this distribution was developped using
VCS2009.06 and no special action need to be taken if you are using
the 2009.06 release of VCS.

Howeber, it may be a good idea to define the symbol `VCS2009_06 when
compiling the SystemVerilog source code to support possible required
work-arounds in future release of this distribution. This can be
accomplished from the command line using the +define option as shown below:

  % vcs -sverilog +define+VCS2009_06 +incdir=$VMM_HOME/sv ...
