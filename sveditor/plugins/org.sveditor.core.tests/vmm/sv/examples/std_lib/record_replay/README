This test demonstrates the usage of vmm_channel, vmm_xactor_iter and vmm_opts class.

Usage:
======
1) vmm_channel
   Parameterized vmm_channel is used in the environment and the driver.
   Record/Playback capability, set_consumer is used

2) vmm_xactor_iter
   foreach macro for iterator is used for general and specific(only generators)
   transactor iterations.

3) vmm_opts
   Runtime control of num. of channels, record/playback mode, num of
   transactions is done through this class.

Files:
======
1) trans.sv - transaction class with predefined macros.

2) driver.sv - driver class which gets transaction objects 
               from a set of input channels.

3) tb_cfg.sv - Configuration class to configure number of channels,
               number of transactions, etc.
               This class shows the usage of vmm_opts
               The fields in this class can be controlled during runtime

4) tb_env.sv - Environment class which shows vmm_channel capabilities,
               vmm_xactor_iter macros.

5) test.sv   - program block which instantiates and run environment object.
